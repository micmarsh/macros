# macros

Some clojure macros, so far just "defntest"

## Usage

```clojure
(defntest addThreeThings
    {[1 2 3] 6
     [3 1 4] 8
     [0 6 7] 13}
     [x y z]
     (+ x y z))
; defines 'add', and runs given test cases, throwing an exception if one doesn't pass
```
##TODO
* Make defntest macro much less ugly, much more modular (since it's mostly a function)
* Support for '[& args]' form in functions definitions
* Arbitrary ordering of arguments vector and test map relative to one another
* Defining single arguments in test map (use a 'seq?' check)
* Allow pre-evalution input and results in maps (probably related to how macros work in general)
